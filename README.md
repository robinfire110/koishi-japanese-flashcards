# Description
This watchapp gives you a full set of Hiragana and Katakana flashcards at your wrist. Study your kana recognition anytime, anywhere!

I made this watchapp to accompany my own Japanese study. You can completely customize the deck, including how many cards you want in a deck and which kana will be able to show. There are also presets to help give a starting point to customize the flashcards to your need. 

If you wish to install this watchface, please do so through the Rebble App Store link above.

The Pebble documentation is all over the place since they shut down, so feel free to use code from this repo to help you in your own projects. You're free to reference and use this code, but please don't take the whole project and upload it as your own.
